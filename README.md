# Efficient Tangency Portfolio Optimization: Vectorized Correlation Analysis

## Introduction

In this Python project, we further explore mean-variance portfolio optimization, a cornerstone concept in investment theory. 
Our focus is on understanding the impact of correlation between two assets on the tangency portfolio. 
To enhance efficiency by vectorizing the code, we compute tangency portfolio weights for a range of correlations, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the efficient frontier and Capital Market Line (CML). 
By merging theory with practical implementation, this project provides valuable insights for portfolio management and investment decision-making.
